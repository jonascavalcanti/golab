### Challenge: Deployment Evaluation

You have been tasked with developing a function that evaluates a series of deployments of a system and counts how many were successful, failed, or encountered errors.

#### Input:

The input consists of a list of strings, each representing a deployment. Each string is in JSON format and contains the keys "deployment_id" and "status".

- The "deployment_id" is a 12-character string starting with "d-".
- The "status" can be one of the following options: "Success", "Fail", or any other string to indicate an error.

#### Output:

The output should be a list of three integers representing the number of successful deployments, the number of deployments that failed, and the number of deployments that encountered errors, respectively.

#### Constraints:

- The "deployment_id" has exactly 12 characters and starts with "d-".
- The "status" can be any string, but we will consider only "Success" and "Fail" as valid states.

#### Example:

##### Input:
```
[
    {"deployment_id": "d-12345678ab", "status": "Success"},
    {"deployment_id": "d-12345678cd", "status": "ABCDE"},
    {"deployment_id": "d-12345678cd", "status": "Fail"}
]
```

##### Output:
```
[2 1 1]
```

```
