Use the lab-template folder as a model for a new lab. It contains a template for a new lab README.md file. 
If your lab has image files please have them in a sub-folder named "images". If you think other labs may find a particular image useful, copy it under the "images" folder located in the root folder or this project. 
If your lab has other type of files, such as user-data scripts or code, put them in a sub-folder named "files". 
Do not upload videos. Instead, use an external video hosting service such as youtube or vimeo.
